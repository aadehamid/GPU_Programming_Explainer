# Exercise 7: image processing - image sharpening[^1]

## Goal:

The purpose of this exercise is to implement an image processing algorithm on the GPU, namely image sharpening

## Instructions:

- move to subdierctory:
```console
$ cd 07-image-filter/
```
- load CUDA module:
```console
$ module load CUDA
```
- build the application:
```console
$ make all
```

- Run the application on a compute node:
```console
$ srun --partition=gpu --ntasks=1 --gpus=1 prog helmet_in.png helmet_out.png
```
